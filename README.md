## Overview

### ðŸ“˜ Project Background

This project was initially started a year ago with the primary goal of training and evaluating various models on the **VLSP 2016 Vietnamese Sentiment Analysis** dataset.  
Currently, I am in the process of refining the source code, with the intention of transforming this repository into a fully structured, MLOps-ready project.

### ðŸ”§ Current Status

- You can run `run.sh` to conduct experiments.
- You can open `interactive.ipynb` to interact with the components Iâ€™ve implemented â€” both training and testing are supported within the notebook.

### ðŸš€ Future Plans

In future updates, I plan to integrate additional state-of-the-art Vietnamese NLP models such as:

- **ViDeBERTa**
- **PhoGPT**
- *(and more to come)*

Stay tuned!
