## Overview

This project was originally started a year ago. I am currently in the process of finalizing the source code for this repository, with the goal of turning it into a complete MLOps-ready project.

### ðŸ”§ Current Status

- You can run `run.sh` to conduct experiments.
- You can open `interactive.ipynb` to interact with the components Iâ€™ve implemented â€” both training and testing are supported within the notebook.

### ðŸš€ Future Plans

In future updates, I plan to integrate additional state-of-the-art Vietnamese NLP models such as:

- **ViDeBERTa**
- **PhoGPT**
- *(and more to come)*

Stay tuned!
